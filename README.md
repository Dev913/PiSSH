# PiSSH
Just a simple python script written to interact with SSH hosts using paramiko on the raspberry pi.

# Why release such simple script?
Well tbh it was difficult to get paramiko working on pi i had to do a ton of research and eventually found a form on such. Plus this feeling you get when you help people cures depression temporarily.
